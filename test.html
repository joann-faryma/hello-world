        <p>This is my pure HTML site about me and the stuff I do and like. I write a lot all day so I'll keep this brief.</p>

        <p>That was it already! Go look at the next page!</p>

      <p>Yes, this is not pretty, but I made it, and soon I'll learn CSS. But I marked up everything correctly in HTML for now :P </p>
      <p>You know in HTML it's not important if things are pretty, only if they are market up correctly. For example I specified utf-8 so now I can write things like this: <span lang="ja" title="something in japanese">ご飯が熱い。</span></p>
